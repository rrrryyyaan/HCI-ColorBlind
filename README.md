# HCI-ColorBlind
Mini project 1 for HCI

How To Run:
Step 1: Download and install Python (preferably python 3.7.7 or greater)

Step 2: Install PyGame by using Pip. Open a command prompt and input the below command:
Command: python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
More info on how to install PyGame here: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

Step 3: Download 'ColorBlind.py' and place in a location you'll remember (preferably your Desktop)

Step 4: Open up your Windows Search bar (pressing 'Windows key' or click the Windows/Search Icon on the bottom right of your screen) and search for 'IDLE', open this Python IDE application. Alternatively, you may be able to find this application where you installed python.

Step 5: Once you have opened 'IDLE', it will open a Python shell. Simply click 'File' on the top right, then 'Open'

Step 6: Once a file explorer pops up, find where you placed 'ColorBlind.py' and open that file. This will open the python file with the IDLE IDE

Step 7: On your new window, where you opened 'ColorBlind.py' (it'll show the name in the top bar of the application), simply select 'Run', then 'Run Module'. Alternatively, you can just press 'F5' to run the module.

Step 8: The application will load up and the first current bus stop will show up in about 10 seconds. You'll get a message 'You are arriving shortly' when a new current bus stop is about to show up.

How to Use:
As stated in step 8 of the tutorial,, on first startup, the first current bus stop will take about 10 seconds to show up.
When a new current bus stop shows up, simply select the color above that is the same as the 'Current Stop'. If you get it right, your 'Actual Arrival' and 'Delay' will be updated to show you how you did for each bus stop. This will run for about 30 bus stops to get a decent amount of data for us to analyze.

How to Send Us Your Data:
